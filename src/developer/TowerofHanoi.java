     * The main method of the program. It functions as follows: An int value
     * is passed via the commandline arguments which is then used to determine
     * the minimum number of steps the process will take. From there, an 
     * array is filled with all disks starting locations. This array will be
     * used throughout the program to keep track of disks last position. This is
     * necessary iteratavely because recursively, stacked methods keep track of 
     * this inherently. From there, the program enters a loop that is bounded by
     * the minimum number of processes. Inside the loops, the program begins 
     * by determining if the number of disks on tower A are odd or even. For an
     * even number of starting disks, the program will function by moving all 
     * disks to tower c. For an odd number of disks, they will all be moved to 
     * tower b. This is for calculation sake, and does not effect the functionality
     * of the program. During the process, all conclusions are printed via
     * system.out.println and additional println()'s are for spacing purposes only.
     * When the program has reached the minimum number of processes, it assumes
     * all disks are in their proper locations and terminates. A try/catch/finally
     * block protects the programs integrity  from ridiculously ignorant users.
     * NOTE: Comments reading, "Iterative vs Recursive" highlight the downside
     * of solving this problem iteratively.
